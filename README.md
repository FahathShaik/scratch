Hyderabadi biryani is a dish of rice, meat, and spices that is popular in Hyderabad, India. It is made with basmati rice, goat or chicken, and a mixture of spices, including turmeric, coriander, cumin, garam masala, and saffron. The rice is cooked separately from the meat, and then they are layered together in a pot and cooked over a low heat. Hyderabadi biryani is often served with raita, a yogurt-based condiment.

Here is a recipe for Hyderabadi biryani:

Ingredients:

* 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1/2 cup plain yogurt
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
* 1 tablespoon ground turmeric
* 1 tablespoon ground coriander
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 1 cup basmati rice, rinsed and drained
* 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
* 1/4 cup chopped mint
* 1/4 cup chopped cashews
* 1/4 cup raisins

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, combine the chicken, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, coriander, cumin, garam masala, cayenne pepper, and salt. Mix well to coat the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or overnight.
2. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken and marinade and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Add the rice and cook for 5 minutes, or until the rice is almost tender. Drain the rice and set aside.
4. In a large pot, combine the chicken, rice, cilantro, mint, cashews, and raisins. Mix well to combine.
5. Bring the pot to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the chicken is tender.
6. Remove the pot from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
